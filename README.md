# Recipe Book App

The **Recipe Book App** is designed to help users search for recipes through an external API. It returns a list of matching recipes along with details like ingredients, instructions, and images. This project focuses on integrating APIs, handling HTTP requests, and presenting the fetched data in a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- Search for recipes by keyword (e.g., "pasta," "chicken").
- View detailed information about each recipe, including ingredients and instructions.
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop viewing.
  
## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The scripting language for making API requests and handling DOM manipulation.
- **HTML5/CSS3**: For structuring and styling the user interface.
- **Recipe API**: To retrieve recipe data from an external source.
